# Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis
Customer Satisfaction Analysis – Explanation of how to calculate the normal distribution using standard deviation to understand data spread in line with the Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7%).

This analysis applies the normal distribution and standard deviation to measure how customer satisfaction scores are spread across the dataset, following the Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7%). By calculating the proportion of data within one, two, and three standard deviations from the mean, we can assess whether the distribution approximates a normal bell curve or shows skewness.

Key Statistical Measures Used:
	•	Mean & Median → to understand central tendency
	•	Variance & Standard Deviation → to measure data spread
	•	Quartiles & Interquartile Range (IQR) → to identify spread of middle 50% and detect outliers
	•	Skewness & Kurtosis → to check asymmetry and tail heaviness of the distribution
